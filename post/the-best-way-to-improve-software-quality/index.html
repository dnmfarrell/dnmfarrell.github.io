<p>A few years ago I was working on a team that owned a web app for our enterprise customers. It had been forked from our original app specifically to meet the needs of larger clients. Despite both apps' shared heritage, they were not similarly reliable. My team&rsquo;s app build almost never failed, yet the original app build was red a third of the time. Since a red build prevented new deployments of the app, it slowed a lot of people down.</p>
<p>Both apps were maintained by large numbers of software engineers, and the distribution of talent and experience was similar. I bandied together with some other frustrated engineers to try and solve the problem.</p>
<p>First we manually investigated each failed build, and categorized and counted the root causes. But apart from flaky tests, we found no pattern. Next we tried bisecting every new build failure and private-messaging the engineer responsible. This helped a little, but many engineers did not respond quickly, and some resented being pinged outside of their working hours. In response we built a bot that would bisect every broken build and announce the name of the perpetrator in a public Slack channel. Yet the broken builds continued.</p>
<p>I sensed that we had a people problem. My suggestion that failed builds be tallied by team, and reported in the weekly manager meeting was not taken up (by management). Like a hyperactive traffic light, the app build continued to flip-flop between red and green. The problem seemed intractable, so we gave up.</p>
<p>Months later, an engineer heroically separated the troubled app into smaller apps and the problem solved itself. The difference was whilst our team owned the enterprise app, <em>three</em> teams shared ownership of the original. With no one accountable, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a> had taken hold.¹ ²</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<li>The variations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway&rsquo;s Law</a> are also relevant.</li>
<li>This effect has been observed in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2025113.2025119">published research</a> too.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to discuss builds without mentioning CICD. I ignore it here because a lack of CICD doesn&rsquo;t explain the difference between the two apps' build reliability. CICD can help - for sure - but ownership is more important.</p>
<p>You might be wondering if every app has a single owner, how to share code? We use these conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common code is kept in a directory per programming language, and every language has a &ldquo;guild&rdquo; which owns its common code. Common code is only allowed to depend on open source, and other common code.</li>
<li>Apps must place any public libraries they provide under the <code>public/</code> directory in their root app directory. Apps may depend only on open source, common and other app&rsquo;s public code. Every app is owned by a single team.</li>
</ul>
