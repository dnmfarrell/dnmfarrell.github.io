  <p class="description">Stop Spark warning that it truncated the query plan</p>
  <p><em class="date">November 14, 2022</em></p>

<p>Apache Spark is a chatty application; it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">logs early and often</a>. Sure, some log messages increase Spark&rsquo;s observability, but others seem questionable. Like logging query plans, which can add over 1MB of text to a single log message.ยน</p>
<p>Writing enormous log messages causes issues with our logging pipeline, so at $work we set the Spark config option <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html">spark.sql.maxPlanStringLength</a> to 0. This stops Spark from logging query plans. However it has an unfortunate consequence:</p>
<p><img src="/images/silencing-sparks-most-annoying-warning/log-output.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I understand the intention, but this is silly. If I&rsquo;ve set the limit to zero, <em>every</em> query plan is going to exceed it.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;truncated&rdquo; warning actually comes in 2 flavors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truncated the string representation of a plan since it was too long. The plan had length ${length} and the maximum is ${maxLength}. This behavior can be adjusted by setting &lsquo;spark.sql.maxPlanStringLength&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truncated the string representation of a plan since it was too large. This behavior can be adjusted by setting &lsquo;spark.sql.maxPlanStringLength&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick fix for this is to raise the priority threshold of the relevant log4j loggers:</p>
<pre><code>log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.StringUtils=ERROR
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util=ERROR
</code></pre>
<p>This works on Spark 3.x. As this is the only warning emitted by these loggers, raising their threshold to error doesn&rsquo;t block other warnings.</p>
<p>It would be nice if a future version of Spark stopped logging query plans altogether, but this might be inconvenient for some users. A backwards-compatible solution would be to add a new configuration option which disables logging of query plans. This declarative approach avoids the implicit disabling of setting <code>spark.sql.maxPlanStringLength</code> to 0, and the need to warn about it in case of user error.</p>

<li>In practice. In theory they can be much longer as the default plan length string limit is 2^31-16 bytes (2 GB).</li>
