<p>Last week at work I had to whip up a script to process several thousand ids for product analysis on a new feature we&rsquo;re launching. The processing included making HTTP requests to a service, and I was on a deadline, so the script had to be concurrent. Here&rsquo;s what I came up with:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
startline=2
setsize=1200
for i in {1..5};do
  tail -n+$startline ids.tsv \
    | cut -f4 \
    | head -n $setsize \
    | ./get-service.bash \
    &gt; output/$startline.tsv&amp;
  startline=$((startline+setsize))
done
wait
</code></pre>
<p>It combines <code>tail</code> and <code>head</code> to split the source file into five streams that are piped to the get-service script, which reads from STDIN and makes an HTTP GET request for each line of input.</p>
<p>It worked, but a couple of things nagged at me. The first is that <code>open</code> and <code>seek</code> is called on the input file five times, but each line of input is only used once. What if the input file was <em>really</em> large, or an infinite stream? The second is that the script is too-specific — I wrote one just like this for another urgent data-processing request last month! So I wanted to generalize the pattern of distributing an input stream among a pool of workers.</p>
<p>I call the program <a href="https://gist.github.com/dnmfarrell/bea84b3627bdd40f65964b6cc150252c">forklift</a>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
declare -i num_workers=1
declare -i num_fifos=0
declare -i next_fifo=1
declare -a fifos=(&quot;&quot;) # zeroth unused

new_fifo() {
  local fn=&quot;${TMPDIR-/tmp}/forklift-$1&quot;
  fifos[$1]=&quot;$fn&quot;
  num_fifos=$((num_fifos+1))
  mkfifo &quot;$fn&quot;
  eval &quot;tail -f '$fn' --pid $$ | ${cmd/\{\{w\}\}/$1} &amp;&quot;
}

cleanup() {
  for i in $(seq 1 ${num_fifos});do
    rm -f &quot;${fifos[$i]}&quot;
  done
}
trap cleanup EXIT

# process args
while getopts &quot;w:&quot; opt;do
  case &quot;$opt&quot; in
    'w') num_workers=&quot;$OPTARG&quot;;;
  esac
done
shift $((OPTIND-1))
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
  echo -e &quot;Must provide 1 command. Usage:\n\tforklift [-w #] command&quot;
  exit 1
fi
declare cmd=&quot;$1&quot;

# process input
while read -r;do
  ((next_fifo &gt; num_fifos)) &amp;&amp; new_fifo $next_fifo
  echo &quot;$REPLY&quot; &gt; &quot;${fifos[$next_fifo]}&quot;
  if ((next_fifo==num_workers)); then
    next_fifo=1
  else
    next_fifo=$((next_fifo+1))
  fi
done
</code></pre>
<p>It starts by declaring a bunch of globals and two functions: <code>new_fifo</code> creates a named pipe (fifo) and forks a worker to read from it. Named pipes are like regular pipes except they can be passed around by filepath, not just inherited. That enables the script to fork a worker and have <code>tail -f</code> block on read until the script starts writing to the fifo. One downside of fifos is they need to be explicitly removed, and that&rsquo;s where the <code>cleanup</code> routine comes in. It deletes any fifos that were created and is triggered by the EXIT signal handler. The reason for this indirection is multiple <code>trap</code> calls for the same signal name replace, rather than stack.</p>
<p>The next stanza processes arguments; it accepts a <code>-w</code> option for the number of workers to use, and a command to run. The odd-looking command <code>shift $((OPTIND-1))</code> removes processed-options from the argument stack so all that&rsquo;s left (should be) the command to run.</p>
<p>The final paragraph loops over each line of input and creates a fifo worker if needed. This laziness avoids the edge case where fewer lines of input are received than workers forked, leaving zombies. The loop round-robin distributes input between the fifos.</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Using bash as a forking server is never going to break any speed records. Pipes and fifos are generally fast because they avoid filesystem IO, but are not the fastest option for IPC:¹</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data has to be copied from user space in one process to a kernel buffer and then back to user space which is expensive (message queues and sockets have the same disadvantage).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, assuming the forked command is doing something slow like making an internet request per line of input, these limitations won&rsquo;t matter much.</p>
<h3 id="capturing-output">Capturing Output</h3>
<p>What if the forked workers produce output that you need to capture? Imagine:</p>
<pre><code>cat input.csv | forklift -w 5 'foo &gt; output.tsv'
</code></pre>
<p>This will fork five workers, but they will all write to <code>output.tsv</code>, clobbering each others' results. My original script used the line number offset in the filename: <code>output/$startline.tsv</code>. This works, but the filenames have odd numbers in them (2, 1202, 2402 …).</p>
<p>The fix for this is to include the template variable <code>{{w}}</code> which forklift replaces with the worker id:</p>
<pre><code>cat input.csv | forklift -w 5 'foo &gt; output/{{w}}.tsv'
</code></pre>
<p>This will create <code>output/1.tsv</code>, <code>output/2.tsv</code> and so on.</p>
