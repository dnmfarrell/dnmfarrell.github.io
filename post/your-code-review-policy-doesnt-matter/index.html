<p>Recently at work we&rsquo;ve instituted a change to require code review by default. The merge request owner can disable the review requirement in GitLab but the intention is to always review. Some co-workers think this change is great, others worry about the additional overhead and loss of velocity.</p>
<p>I used to think stuff like this matters - I don&rsquo;t anymore. Moreover I don&rsquo;t think you believe it either.</p>
<p>Try this thought experiment: think of a time you were part of a high performing software project. Now ask yourself: would a different code review policy have substantially changed the outcome?</p>
<p>This is not to say that code review isn&rsquo;t useful, it can be. But when we think about the factors that drive high performance, it&rsquo;s not important. So what is important?</p>
<p>At their core, high performing teams have a shared vision that they are excited to manifest. Everything else (a sense of urgency, high trust etc) seems to be derived from there.</p>
<p>I think most of us understand what&rsquo;s involved in creating a project vision, it&rsquo;s the excitement part that harder to pin down.</p>
<p>One way to make a vision more exciting is to crank up the ambition. For example instead of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The v2 conversion funnel project will revamp the branding and simplify the steps of the customer funnel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>try:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The v2 conversion funnel project will create the best customer onboarding experience in our industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is no side quest. There&rsquo;s a feeling of frontier, of the challenge of encountering and overcoming new problems to create a magical experience for customers. And of winning. The team members tell themselves &ldquo;this is work that matters&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to study how this project team does code review to learn &ldquo;what works&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s like confusing a symptom for the disease. The team will do whatever they think is necessary in service of the vision, and code review may have helped them a lot, or not much.</p>
<p>To do great things, we have to see ourselves for what we really are. We are not commodities. We are not Full Time Equivalents on a spreadsheet. So forget about the code review policy, and focus on contributing to exciting visions that make the World better. And we&rsquo;ll all be happier for it.</p>
