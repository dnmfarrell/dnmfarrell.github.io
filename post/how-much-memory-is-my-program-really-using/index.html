<h2>How Much Memory Is My Program Really Using?</h2>

<em class="date">February 10, 2022</em>

<p>It sounds like such a simple question - but virtual memory makes measuring real memory use complicated. Popular tools like ps and top report virtual, resident and shared memory consumption, but these are unsatisfactory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared memory is not apportioned per process using it so it is overstated.</li>
<li>Resident memory includes shared memory, so it overstates as well.</li>
<li>Virtual memory includes resident memory plus data held in swap, which is not in main memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately unless you are running a Linux kernel older than the last financial crisis, you have a better option: Proportional Set Size (PSS)¹. This is the amount of private memory the process is using, plus its proportional allocation of shared memory. The kernel reports this data per PID in <code>/proc/$pid/smaps</code>. The file lists each memory block mapped to the process, and its properties. You <em>could</em> wrangle the smaps data with shell code, but you don&rsquo;t have to! The <a href="https://www.selenic.com/smem/">smem tool</a> does that, and it can filter/format too. Modern kernels also aggregate the data in <code>/proc/$pid/smaps_rollup</code> which is convenient to grep and less error prone than rolling your own aggregator².</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Memory concepts can be a bit abstract, so let&rsquo;s look at an example. This Perl <a href="https://gist.github.com/dnmfarrell/33284a671d6d62dc134d9293d12c4a29">script</a> creates a big array of numbers, forks a child process and prints both processes RSS and PSS using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Linux::Smaps">Linux::Smaps</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pre">#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use Linux::Smaps;

sub print_memusage {
  my $smaps = Linux::Smaps-&gt;new;
  printf &quot;% 6s % 9d % 9d KB % 9d KB\n&quot;, $_[0], $$, $smaps-&gt;rss, $smaps-&gt;pss;
}

my @bigarray = (1..1_000_000);
print &quot; LABEL       PID       RSS          PSS\n&quot;;
my $pid = fork;
die &quot;failed to fork $!&quot; unless defined $pid;
if ($pid == 0) {
  print_memusage(&quot;CHILD&quot;);
  exit;
}
print_memusage(&quot;PARENT&quot;);
waitpid $pid, 0;
</code></pre>
<p>Now what do you think the output will show? The child process receives a copy of its parent&rsquo;s memory - so has real memory use doubled? No! The parent and child <em>share</em> the memory; if the child tries to write to any memory it inherited, the kernel will copy the memory page for the child to write to (this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">copy-on-write</a>).</p>
<p>Running the script, I get this output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pre"> LABEL       PID       RSS          PSS
 CHILD   1393612     81924 KB     40661 KB
PARENT   1393611     85356 KB     42178 KB
</code></pre>
<p>The total resident memory is 167,280 KB but we know that&rsquo;s a lie - there&rsquo;s one big array in memory and both processes are sharing it. The total PSS of 82,839 KB is more accurate.</p>
<h3 id="if-my-program-exits-how-much-memory-can-be-reclaimed">If my program exits, how much memory can be reclaimed?</h3>
<p>Whilst Proportional Set Size is useful for gauging how much memory a process is using, it overstates how much memory will be freed when the process exits as shared memory cannot be reclaimed.</p>
<p>To measure free-able memory, use Unique Set Size (USS); the sum of all memory pages private to the process. The kernel does not report USS, you have to calculate it using the memory map data in <code>/proc/$pid/maps</code>. Conveniently, smem already reports USS so there&rsquo;s no need to write your own solution unless you&rsquo;re curious³.</p>
<pre><code class="language-pre">bash -c $'smem -c \'pid vss rss pss uss\' --processfilter bash | grep &quot;PID\|$$&quot;'
  PID      VSS      RSS      PSS      USS
1412528     9500     3184      341      260
</code></pre>
<p>This Bash one liner prints its own memory statistics by running <code>smem</code> and filtering the output to itself. The USS is 260 KB so I expect to free that much real memory when it exits.</p>
<p>At 341 KB, PSS is 81 KB higher, and comprised of its proportional share of /bin/bash (already in memory as I&rsquo;m launching this from a Bash shell), libc and other shared libraries, and the system locales. The Bash program starts quicker as by sharing the libraries already in memory, the kernel doesn&rsquo;t have to copy them to the program&rsquo;s memory. Additionally, shared memory reduces overall memory use. Virtual memory complexifies operating systems but it has a lot of benefits.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>PSS was created by Matt Mackall - this LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/230975/">article</a> has more info on its origins.</li>
<li>The motivation for <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-fsdevel/patch/20170810001557.147285-1-dancol@google.com/">smaps_rollup</a> was Android taking too long to sample large processes' memory in order to balance memory pools</li>
<li>And if you <em>are</em> curious, this neat golang <a href="https://github.com/brk0v/sre-page-cache-article/blob/main/uss/main.go">script</a> by Viacheslav Biriukov calculates the Unique Set Size for a given PID.</li>
