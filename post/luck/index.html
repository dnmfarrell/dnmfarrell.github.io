<pre><code class="language-prose">We were asked to build an app in Go,
Fortunately we were experienced programmers,
Unfortunately our experience was with Java,
Fortunately Go is simpler than Java,
Unfortunately we wrote thousands of lines of code,
Fortunately adding dependencies was easy,
Unfortunately we accumulated many CVEs,
Fortunately our CICD tracks vulnerabilities,
Unfortunately it kept blocking deployments,
Fortunately we exempted our app,
Unfortunately we lost a lot of data,
Fortunately we launched on time,
Unfortunately our users preferred the old app,
Fortunately we are getting to build a v2,
Unfortunately it will be in Rust.
