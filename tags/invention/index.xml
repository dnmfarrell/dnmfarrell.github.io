      <description>&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Technology-What-How-Evolves/dp/1416544062&#34;&gt;The Nature of Technology&lt;/a&gt;, W. Brian Arthur describes technology as combinations of other technologies. This description poses a couple of questions for computing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, take a software program like Git. To figure out what technologies Git is made of, perhaps all we have to do is inspect its dependencies? Surprisingly, Git has few real dependencies.¹&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, note how Arthur&amp;rsquo;s description of technology is recursive — where does it end? His answer is in elemental technologies. These are technologies which deliver an effect based on a natural phenomenon:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
