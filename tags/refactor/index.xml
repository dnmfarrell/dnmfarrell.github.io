      <description>Program speed is an important factor in programming. No one wants their program to execute more slowly. As a general purpose programming language, Perl is usually fast enough for most things, and when it isn&amp;rsquo;t, we have some great tools to help us make it faster. We can use the Benchmark module to compare code and Devel::NYTProf to produce detailed analyses of our programs.
This article is about Devel::Timer, another module I like to use when I want to optimize an existing subroutine, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how long each statement within the subroutine takes to execute.</description>
