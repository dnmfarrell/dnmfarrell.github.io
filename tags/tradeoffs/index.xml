      <title>Is Code Review Always A Good Thing?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Code review is one of those hygienic things most developers believe they ought to do, like kitchen workers washing their hands, but don&amp;rsquo;t always do. Yet tech articles tend to be unanimously in favor of code review, extolling its benefits (&amp;ldquo;catch bugs&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;maintain code consistency&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;transfer knowledge&amp;rdquo;). So if restaurants can require workers to wash their hands, maybe organizations can require their developers to review every code change?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking I think we can lump all of code review&amp;rsquo;s benefits under the category of &amp;ldquo;improve code quality&amp;rdquo;. I know there is no agreed-upon definition of code quality but allow me to channel my inner &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it&#34;&gt;Justice Potter&lt;/a&gt; and wave away your objections for now. (What of &amp;ldquo;transfer knowledge&amp;rdquo;? - first I think unfamiliar reviewers reviewing code changes is &lt;a href=&#34;https://gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/&#34;&gt;inefficient&lt;/a&gt; compared to them interacting with the code by making a small change and/or writing tests for it. Second whatever knowledge is accumulated by the reviewer should ultimately lead to higher quality code output anyway).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
