      <title>Your Code Review Policy Doesn&#39;t Matter As Much As You Might Think</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently at work we&amp;rsquo;ve instituted a change to require code review by default. The merge request owner can disable the review requirement in GitLab but the intention is to always review. Some co-workers think this change is great, others worry about the additional overhead and loss of velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used to think stuff like this matters - I don&amp;rsquo;t anymore. Moreover I don&amp;rsquo;t think you believe it either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try this thought experiment: think of a time you were part of a high performing software project. Now ask yourself: would a different code review policy have substantially changed the outcome?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
