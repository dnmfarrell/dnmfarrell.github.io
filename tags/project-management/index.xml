      <description>Recently at work we&amp;rsquo;ve instituted a change to require code review by default. The merge request owner can disable the review requirement in GitLab but the intention is to always review. Some co-workers think this change is great, others worry about the additional overhead and loss of velocity.
I used to think stuff like this matters - I don&amp;rsquo;t anymore. Moreover I don&amp;rsquo;t think you believe it either.
Try this thought experiment: think of a time you were part of a high performing software project.</description>
