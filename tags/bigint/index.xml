      <description>&amp;ldquo;Big data&amp;rdquo; is an overused term, but when you&amp;rsquo;re actually working with big data, every bit can count. Shaving several bits from data structure used billions of times can save a lot of space. A few months ago I was working on a job distribution system; it would send millions of jobs out every day. We wanted to capture every decision made by the system, so that a user could later query the system to understand why a job had or hadn&amp;rsquo;t been sent to a partner.</description>
