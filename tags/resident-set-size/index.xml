      <description>It sounds like such a simple question - but virtual memory makes measuring real memory use complicated. Popular tools like ps and top report virtual, resident and shared memory consumption, but these are unsatisfactory:
 Shared memory is not apportioned per process using it so it is overstated. Resident memory includes shared memory, so it overstates as well. Virtual memory includes resident memory plus data held in swap, which is not in main memory.</description>
