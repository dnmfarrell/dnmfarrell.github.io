      <description>In his book The Nature of Technology, W. Brian Arthur describes technology as combinations of other technologies.
Take a software program like Git. To figure out what technologies Git is made of, perhaps all we have to do is inspect its dependencies? Surprisingly, Git has no real dependencies apart from libc.ยน
Arthur&amp;rsquo;s description of technology is recursive, so where does it end? Arthur&amp;rsquo;s answer is in elemental technologies. These are technologies which deliver an effect based on a natural phenomenon:</description>

      <description>In the 1940s Bell Aircraft used an experimental approach to build the first commercial helicopter:ยน
 At Gardenville, we built things, tested them, modified them until they worked, and then made the drawings. &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;The Bell Notes, Arthur M. Young, 
 The project manager contrasted this with how they built airplanes:
 The main engineering group made drawings, sent them to the plant, and only the project manager ever saw the product fly.</description>

      <description>Twenty five years ago the most popular solution for web apps was known as &amp;ldquo;LAMP&amp;rdquo; (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). A typical web app today, deployed with Kubernetes might comprise of 5x as many technologies. That we don&amp;rsquo;t use such acronyms anymore tells us something about how software engineering has changed.
This has mostly been a journey from implicit to explicit state. For example, Kubernetes manifests declare how much memory an application will need.</description>
