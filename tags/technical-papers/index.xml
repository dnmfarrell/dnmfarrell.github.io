      <description>Specifically the Brother HL-L2350DW. I bought it to print coloring pages and puzzles for my kids, and it was great for that. Cheap and quick.
But then I started printing out technical papers, reading them, marking them up, putting them down, and referring to them later. I retained more of the material, drew more cross-inferences with other papers, but more than that, I enjoyed the reading experience more.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why.</description>
