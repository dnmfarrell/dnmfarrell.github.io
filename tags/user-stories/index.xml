      <description>Last week I wrote about novelty in software engineering, and its relation to complexity. Now most of us are familiar with thinking tools for managing complexity such as documenting requirements, diagramming, statistics and so on. But novelty requires us to be creative, to invent new solutions.
So this week I want to share one of the most helpful tools I&amp;rsquo;ve found for creative thought in software: user stories. And I don&amp;rsquo;t mean &amp;ldquo;tickets in Jira&amp;rdquo; - in fact I think user stories make for a poor planning tool, which I&amp;rsquo;ll explain later.</description>
