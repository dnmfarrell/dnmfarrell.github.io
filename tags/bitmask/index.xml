      <description>This week I wrote a UTF-8 encoder/decoder. Perl already comes with UTF-8 encoding features built-in, so this wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary, but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s nice to understand how things work. The UTF-8 scheme is defined in RFC 3629.
What does a UTF-8 encoder do? UTF-8 is a scheme for encoding Unicode sequences of codepoints as bytes/octets. A codepoint is just a number, that identifies the Unicode entry (such as 0x24 which is a dollar sign).</description>
