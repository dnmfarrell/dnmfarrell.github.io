      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perl has had great testing tools for a long time, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2&#34;&gt;Test2&lt;/a&gt; is the single biggest improvement to Perl testing in years. One of my favorite Test2 features is how easy it is to extend it with new tools, and today I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how I wrote my first tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;dealing-with-known-test-failures&#34;&gt;Dealing with known test failures&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally when your tests fail, it means that something needs to be fixed, and that thing is fixable. However in the Real Worldâ„¢ things aren&amp;rsquo;t always that simple. For example you might investigate a failure, figure out the root cause, but the person to fix it is on vacation. Or perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s a datetime bug in the code, and it will resolve itself in a few days. The key here is that the failure is understood and not serious but also impractical to fix in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
